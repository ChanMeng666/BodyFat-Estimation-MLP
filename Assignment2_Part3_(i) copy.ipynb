    "## 1. Strong Positive Correlations\n",
    "Based on both visual analysis and correlation coefficients, several attributes showed significant relationships with body fat percentage:\n",
    "- **Abdomen circumference** demonstrated the strongest positive correlation (r = 0.670)\n",
    "- **Thigh circumference** showed a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.493)\n",
    "- **Knee circumference** also exhibited a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.478)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Weak or Negative Correlations\n",
    "Some attributes showed weak or negative relationships with body fat percentage:\n",
    "- **Wrist circumference** displayed a weak negative correlation (r = -0.096)\n",
    "- **Height** showed a weak negative correlation (r = -0.201)\n",
    "- **Body Density** exhibited a perfect negative correlation (r = -0.999), which is expected given that body fat percentage is typically calculated from body density\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Visualization Insights\n",
    "- The scatter matrix plots revealed clear linear relationships between body fat percentage and several measurements, particularly abdomen circumference\n",
    "- The parallel coordinates plot highlighted consistent patterns between certain body measurements and body fat percentage, reinforcing the correlation findings\n",
    "- The stacked line plot demonstrated that some measurements tend to follow similar trends, suggesting potential interrelationships between input variables"
