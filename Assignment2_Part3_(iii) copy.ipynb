    "# (iii) Correlation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Strong Negative Correlation**\n",
    "   - Body Density shows an extremely strong negative correlation (-0.99) with Body Fat percentage, making it the most significant predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strong Positive Correlations**\n",
    "   Several body measurements show strong positive correlations with Body Fat:\n",
    "   - Abdomen circumference (0.81)\n",
    "   - Chest circumference (0.70)\n",
    "   - Hip circumference (0.63)\n",
    "   - Weight (0.61)\n",
    "   - Thigh circumference (0.56)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Moderate Correlations**\n",
    "   - Knee circumference (0.51)\n",
    "   - Biceps circumference (0.49)\n",
    "   - Neck circumference (0.49)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Weak Correlations**\n",
    "   - Forearm, Wrist, Age, and Ankle show weak correlations (|r| < 0.4)\n",
    "   - Height shows virtually no correlation (-0.09)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison with Part (i) Qualitative Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Confirmations**\n",
    "   - The strong correlation of Abdomen circumference was correctly identified in the qualitative analysis\n",
    "   - The weak relationship with Height was also correctly observed\n",
    "   - The significant negative correlation with Density was noted in both analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Differences**\n",
    "   - The quantitative analysis revealed stronger correlations for some variables (like Chest and Hip) that weren't as apparent in the qualitative analysis of the first 30 data points\n",
    "   - The full dataset analysis showed more variables with significant correlations than were visible in the limited qualitative analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implications for Model Development\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the reduced input model in part (iv), we can confidently use the following variables as they show strong correlations (|r| > 0.4):\n",
    "   - Abdomen\n",
    "   - Chest\n",
    "   - Hip\n",
    "   - Weight\n",
    "   - Thigh\n",
    "   - Knee\n",
    "   - Biceps\n",
    "   - Neck\n",
    "   - Density\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We can safely exclude:\n",
    "   - Height\n",
    "   - Ankle\n",
    "   - Age\n",
    "   - Wrist\n",
    "   - Forearm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multicollinearity**: The heatmap reveals strong correlations between many input variables (especially body measurements), which could affect the model's performance and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Redundancy**: Some highly correlated measurements (e.g., Chest and Abdomen at 0.92) might provide redundant information, suggesting potential for further input reduction."
