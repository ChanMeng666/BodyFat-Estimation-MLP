    "# (v) Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison of Full and Reduced Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Model (14 features):\n",
    "1. Top 3 most influential features: Density (ST: 0.966241), Abdomen (ST: 0.021510), Ankle (ST: 0.014437)\n",
    "2. Nonlinearity measure: 0.0046\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reduced Model (9 features):\n",
    "1. Top 3 most influential features: Density (ST: 0.985561), Weight (ST: 0.026100), Thigh (ST: 0.024532)\n",
    "2. Nonlinearity measure: 0.0168\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Importance**: In both models, Density is by far the most influential feature, with a Total-order sensitivity index (ST) of over 0.96. This indicates that Density alone accounts for the vast majority of the variance in the body fat percentage predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nonlinear Relationships**: The difference between first-order (S1) and total-order (ST) indices indicates the presence of nonlinear relationships and interaction effects. The reduced model shows a higher degree of nonlinearity (0.0168) compared to the full model (0.0046), suggesting that the reduced model captures more complex relationships between the inputs and the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interaction Effects**: \n",
    "   - Full model: The top interaction is between Density and Weight\n",
    "   - Reduced model: The top interaction is between Density and Thigh\n",
    "   These interactions suggest that these pairs of features have a combined effect on body fat percentage prediction that is greater than their individual effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Efficiency**: The reduced model successfully captures the most important features, as evidenced by the high ST value for Density and the presence of significant interaction effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison with Correlation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The sensitivity analysis reveals some differences from the correlation analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Correlation analysis top features: Abdomen, Chest, Hip\n",
    "2. Sensitivity analysis top features (full model): Density, Abdomen, Ankle\n",
    "3. Sensitivity analysis top features (reduced model): Density, Weight, Thigh\n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison highlights that sensitivity analysis provides a more comprehensive understanding of feature importance, especially for complex nonlinear relationships that neural networks can capture. While correlation analysis only captures linear relationships, sensitivity analysis accounts for both linear and nonlinear relationships, as well as interaction effects between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Improved Input Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the sensitivity analysis results, we can propose an improved set of inputs for the smaller network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retain: Density, Weight, Thigh, Knee, Neck, Biceps\n",
    "2. Add: Ankle, Age, Abdomen\n",
    "3. Consider removing: Chest, Hip\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale:\n",
    "- Density remains the most crucial feature in both models.\n",
    "- Weight, Thigh, Knee, Neck, and Biceps show significant total-order effects in the reduced model.\n",
    "- Ankle, Age, and Abdomen show notable total-order effects in the full model but were not included in the reduced model.\n",
    "- Chest and Hip show relatively low total-order effects in both models and could potentially be removed to simplify the model further."
